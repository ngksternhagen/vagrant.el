* TODO implement function to kill dormant buffers
that is, vagrant buffers with no process running
* TODO allow user to configure what kind of buffer is used for vagrant interaction (particularly ssh)

- plain shell
- ansi-term
- eshell?
* TODO add tests
* TODO use same window
right now these functions pop a window
it's possible that the user wants to use only one window.
could do this by associating currently focused window with *Vagrant* buffer before executing shell command
